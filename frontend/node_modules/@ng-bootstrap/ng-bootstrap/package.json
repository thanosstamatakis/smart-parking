Please check out our list of\n[issues](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/issues) to see all the things we are implementing.\nFeel free to make comments there.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Demo](#demo)\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [SystemJS](#systemjs)\n- [Supported browsers](#supported-browsers)\n- [Contributing to the project](#contributing-to-the-project)\n- [Getting Help](#getting-help)\n- [You think you've found a bug?](#you-think-youve-found-a-bug)\n- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n\n## Demo\n\nView all the directives in action at https://ng-bootstrap.github.io\n\n## Dependencies\nThe only two dependencies are [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) CSS. \nHere is the list of minimal required versions:\n\n| ng-bootstrap | Angular | Bootstrap CSS |\n| ------------ | ------- | ------------- |\n| 1.x.x        | 5.0.2   | 4.0.0         |\n| 2.x.x        | 6.0.0   | 4.0.0         |\n| 3.x.x        | 6.1.0   | 4.0.0         |\n| 4.x.x        | 7.0.0   | 4.0.0         |\n\n## Installation\nAfter installing the above dependencies, install `ng-bootstrap` via:\n```shell\nnpm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap\n```\nOnce installed you need to import our main module:\n```js\nimport {NgbModule} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [NgbModule, ...],\n  ...\n})\nexport class YourAppModule {\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you could only import modules with components you need, ex. pagination and alert. \nThe resulting bundle will be smaller in this case.\n\n```js\nimport {NgbPaginationModule, NgbAlertModule} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [NgbPaginationModule, NgbAlertModule, ...],\n  ...\n})\nexport class YourAppModule {\n}\n```\n\n### SystemJS\nIf you are using SystemJS, you should also adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\n\nIn your SystemJS config file, `map` needs to tell the System loader where to look for `ng-bootstrap`:\n```js\nmap: {\n  '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap': 'node_modules/@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/bundles/ng-bootstrap.js',\n}\n```\n## Supported browsers\n\nWe support the same browsers and versions supported by both Bootstrap 4 and Angular, whichever is _more_ restrictive.\nSee [this](https://angular.io/guide/browser-support) for up-to-date Angular browser support.\n\n* Chrome (45+)\n* Firefox (40+)\n* IE (10+) \n* Edge (20+)\n* Safari (7+)\n\nAlso check [Bootstrap 4's notes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/#supported-browsers) on browsers support.\n\n## Contributing to the project\n\nPlease check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) doc for contribution guidelines.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nPlease, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ng-bootstrap) where maintainers are looking at questions tagged with `ng-bootstrap`.\n\nStackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:\n* there are hundreds of people willing to help on StackOverflow\n* questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else\n* SO voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.\n\nTo save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.\n\n## You think you've found a bug?\n\nOh, we are ashamed and want to fix it ASAP! But before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a _minimal_ reproduction scenario using https://stackblitz.com. Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:\n* version of Angular used\n* version of this library that you are using\n* 3rd-party libraries used, if any\n* and most importantly - a use-case that fails\n\nA minimal reproduce scenario using https://stackblitz.com allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.\nThe best part is that you do not need to create StackBlitzes from scratch - you can fork one from our [demo page](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components).\n\nWe will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal StackBlitz. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.\n\nUnfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduce scenario using https://stackblitz.com, so if we don't hear back from you we are going to close an issue that don't have enough info to be reproduced.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease take a moment and read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n",
